## Sooo incomplete

_So much so that little of this will actually be used. I haven't had time to work on this but have decided to skip the first phase and rewrite almost entirely._

This is an experiment from playing with the EventSource API using AngularJS and LoopBack.

It's a work in progress, unfinished, possibly buggy, and in need of refactoring.

I've only tested this in Chrome & Firefox for now.


## Installation

You'll need to have LoopBack installed.

If nodemon is also installed,simply 

```sh
npm start
```

Otherwise,

```sh
node .
```
